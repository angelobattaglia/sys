# Make

There are many build systems out there, such as [bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/),
[Maven](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/), [CMake](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/) 
and so on so forth. Make is the standard build system, used by many, especially
after GNU Make, and implementation of it, popularized it.
